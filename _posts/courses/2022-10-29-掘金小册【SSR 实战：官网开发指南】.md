跟着掘金小册【SSR 实战：官网开发指南】实践的代码

（小册地址：<https://juejin.cn/book/7137945369635192836>）

内容：1-5章，SSR原理部分

与此同时，感觉到在写代码的时候中英文切换有些打断节奏，所以想尝试文本、注释以及学习笔记也使用英文来写。

## 1. how to execute ts files on node

theres are two methods

1. using ts-node to run the ts file
2. using webpack to bundle the ts file, and the execute the bundled bundle.js file.

### 1.1 ts-node

### 1.2 webpack bundle and execute

[webpack core concepts](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)

`pnpm install @babel/preset-env babel-loader ts-loader webpack webpack-merge webpack-cli --save-dev`

how to know what dependencies should be installed?
> [create app - webpack](https://createapp.dev/webpack)

how to add tsconfig.json  
`tsc --init`

## 2. nodemon - hot update

so we need to specify the watch list:

`npx nodemon --watch src server_build/bundle.js --ext tsx,ts`

## 3. client and server --- hydrate

There are 3 steps to render a static page.

1. render template page
2. match the router
3. modify the html header

## 4. a bug leads to a more serious bug

1. ~~When I use axios, the console.log print these below:~~
    ~~![screenshot](https://kazoottt-1256684243.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/2022-10-24-135950.png)~~
    ~~It has told us the reason and how to fix, but it's just one module.~~
    ~~We can add all polyfills with `node-polyfill-webpack-plugin`~~

    ~~[How to Polyfill node core modules in webpack 5]("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64557638/how-to-polyfill-node-core-modules-in-webpack-5")~~

    ``` javascript
    // webpack.config.js (we can add it to base config)
    const NodePolyfillPlugin = require("node-polyfill-webpack-plugin")
    module.exports = {
        // Other rules...
        plugins: [
            new NodePolyfillPlugin()
        ]
    }
    ```

2. ~~argument entity must be string, Buffer, or fs.Stats~~
   ~~It's a strange bug, I still don't know the real reason.~~
    ~~![shot](https://kazoottt-1256684243.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/2022-10-25-131207.jpg)~~
    ~~<https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli/issues/598> ==> it does not works for me.~~

### 2022-10-26 finally fixed it

After I did these above, my program cannot run correctly.And finally I find the true reason is that I installed the node polyfill.

It got me think about the joke —— don't modify the codes when the program can run successfully.

## 5. how to fetch the data

We realize the static page render by using ssr before. How should we fetch data? There are two ways:

1. on the cilient side, it's common and esay.
2. on the server side, that is what we learn below.

fetch data on the server side  ==> global data transfer ==>the client side

It's diffcult for me to understand the chapter 6, I'll look back to this later.
